# WebRTC Dependency Fix

## Problem Description

The WebRTC streaming functionality in `ipfs_kit_py` was experiencing two major issues:

1. **Import Error Handling**: Causing import errors when optional dependencies (av, cv2, aiortc) were not installed, breaking the ability to use the entire package even when WebRTC functionality wasn't needed.

2. **Dependency Detection Failures**: Even when dependencies were actually installed, they weren't being properly detected, resulting in error messages like:
   ```
   ipfs_kit_py.webrtc_streaming - INFO - PyAV not found, media handling features will be unavailable
   ipfs_kit_py.webrtc_streaming - INFO - aiortc not found, WebRTC features will be unavailable
   ```

## Solution Approach

The fix implements a comprehensive dependency handling approach that:

1. **Enhanced Dependency Detection**: Implements multiple fallback import methods for each dependency, with improved module name variation handling
2. **Granular Dependency Checking**: Checks for each dependency individually (av, cv2, numpy, aiortc)
3. **Conditional Class Definitions**: Only defines implementation classes when dependencies are available
4. **Stub Implementations**: Provides stub implementations that raise informative errors when used
5. **Proper Import Error Handling**: Ensures the module can be imported even when dependencies are missing
6. **Improved Error Messages**: Provides clear instructions for installing missing dependencies
7. **Dependency Verification Function**: Adds a `check_webrtc_dependencies()` function that can be called from outside modules

## Files Modified

1. **webrtc_streaming.py**: 
   - Added individual dependency availability flags 
   - Implemented multiple fallback import mechanisms for each dependency
   - Added case-insensitive module name handling (e.g., `av` vs `AV`)
   - Implemented additional dependency detection techniques
   - Added detailed logging of dependency detection results
   - Implemented conditional class definitions
   - Added proper stub implementations
   - Improved error messages
   - Created `check_webrtc_dependencies()` function for external verification

2. **high_level_api.py**:
   - Fixed import handling for WebRTC components
   - Added dependency double-checking mechanism on initialization
   - Added automatic correction for dependency flag mismatches
   - Added proper stub implementation for handle_webrtc_signaling
   - Added explicit flags for dependency status
   - Enhanced error messaging with clear installation instructions

3. **mcp/models/ipfs_model.py**:
   - Added WebRTC dependency detection and integration
   - Implemented `_check_webrtc()` method for dependency verification
   - Added `_init_webrtc()` method for WebRTC streaming manager initialization
   - Added graceful degradation when WebRTC is unavailable

## Testing

Several dedicated test scripts were created to verify the fix:

1. **test_webrtc_detection.py**:
   - Verifies that the WebRTC module can be imported without errors
   - Checks that dependency availability flags correctly reflect system state
   - Tests successful creation of WebRTCStreamingManager instance
   - Verifies high_level_api WebRTC integration
   - Confirms that dependency detection works in all contexts

2. **test_webrtc_fix.py**:
   - Tests stub implementations raise proper ImportError when used
   - Verifies high_level_api can be imported without dependency errors
   - Tests graceful degradation behavior

3. **test_mcp_webrtc.py**:
   - Tests MCP server WebRTC integration
   - Verifies IPFSModel properly initializes WebRTC
   - Confirms WebRTC manager is created successfully
   - Tests that WebRTC is available in the server context

This approach allows the codebase to work correctly regardless of whether the optional WebRTC dependencies are installed, while still providing helpful error messages when users attempt to use functionality that requires the missing dependencies.

## Installation Instructions

To use the WebRTC streaming functionality, install with:

```bash
pip install ipfs_kit_py[webrtc]
```

This will install the required dependencies:
- av (PyAV for media handling)
- opencv-python (OpenCV for video processing)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
- aiortc (for WebRTC implementation)

## Future Improvements

For even more robust dependency handling, consider:

1. Adding a proper entry in `setup.py` for the WebRTC extra requirements
2. Implementing lazy imports for more efficient loading
3. Adding functionality level checks rather than just import checks
4. Creating a dependency status endpoint in the API for better diagnostics

## Test Integration Fix

We've also fixed an issue with the WebRTC tests being skipped when running through pytest, even though dependencies were available. 

### Problem with Test Skipping

The tests in `test_webrtc_streaming.py` were being skipped despite:
- WebRTC dependencies being available
- Explicitly setting `_can_test_webrtc = True` in the test file

This was happening because:
1. Pytest import collection behaves differently than direct file execution
2. Syntax errors in `cluster_state_helpers.py` were preventing imports from working properly during test setup

### Solution Implemented

We made several fixes to ensure WebRTC tests can run consistently:

1. **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Fixed critical syntax errors in `cluster_state_helpers.py` that prevented the module from importing correctly

2. **Test File Improvements**: Modified `test_webrtc_streaming.py` to better handle both direct execution and pytest collection with these changes:

   a. **Context Detection**: Added detection of pytest vs. direct execution contexts
   ```python
   # Check if we're in a pytest context or direct import
   import sys
   _in_pytest = any('pytest' in arg for arg in sys.argv) or 'pytest' in sys.modules
   ```

   b. **Advanced Dependency Verification**: Now we check actual functionality, not just imports
   ```python
   # Try creating test instances to verify all dependencies
   if HAVE_WEBRTC:
       test_manager = WebRTCStreamingManager(ipfs_api=None)
       _can_test_webrtc = True
   ```

   c. **Environment Variable Override**: Added flags to force-enable tests
   ```python
   # Check if FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS environment variable is set
   import os
   if os.environ.get('FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS') == '1':
       _can_test_webrtc = True
   ```

### Running WebRTC Tests

To force WebRTC tests to run regardless of dependency detection:

```bash
# Run WebRTC tests with core dependencies
FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS=1 python -m pytest test/test_webrtc_streaming.py

# Run notification tests that require additional dependencies
FORCE_NOTIFICATION_TESTS=1 python -m pytest test/test_webrtc_streaming.py

# Run all WebRTC tests
FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS=1 FORCE_NOTIFICATION_TESTS=1 python -m pytest test/test_webrtc_streaming.py
```

This fix ensures consistent test behavior regardless of how the tests are run, while preserving the ability to skip tests when dependencies truly aren't available.

## WebRTC Signaling Handler Testing

We've also implemented a comprehensive test for the WebRTC signaling handler that was previously skipped due to complexity. The handler test is challenging because it requires mocking:

1. WebSockets with asynchronous iteration support
2. WebRTC signaling message flow
3. Complex interaction between peers
4. Connection establishment and management

### The Testing Approach

Our implementation uses several techniques to effectively test this complex component:

1. **Custom WebSocket Mock with Async Iteration**: We created a mock WebSocket class that supports asynchronous iteration, a key feature needed for testing the signaling handler:
   ```python
   class AsyncIteratorWebSocketMock:
       """Mock WebSocket class with async iterator support."""
       
       def __init__(self):
           self.sent_messages = []
           self.messages_to_receive = []
           self.closed = False
           self.receive_index = 0
           
       # ...async iteration support...
       def __aiter__(self):
           """Support async iteration."""
           return self
           
       async def __anext__(self):
           """Provide next message for async iteration."""
           try:
               message = await self.receive_json()
               return message
           except MockConnectionClosed:
               raise StopAsyncIteration
   ```

2. **Complete Signaling Flow Simulation**: We simulate the complete WebRTC signaling flow with predefined messages:
   - Offer request
   - ICE candidate exchange
   - Session answer
   - Connection establishment

3. **Behavior Verification**: The test verifies that:
   - All client messages are processed
   - Appropriate responses are sent for each message type
   - Connection establishment is confirmed
   - Error cases are properly handled

This test approach ensures that the WebRTC signaling handler properly processes client messages and maintains the correct signaling state throughout the WebRTC connection lifecycle.

### Test Usage

The WebRTC signaling handler test is now included in the standard test suite and will run when WebRTC tests are enabled:

```bash
# Run just the signaling handler test
FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS=1 python -m pytest test/test_webrtc_streaming.py::TestWebRTCStreaming::test_handle_webrtc_streaming

# Run all WebRTC tests including the signaling handler
FORCE_WEBRTC_TESTS=1 python -m pytest test/test_webrtc_streaming.py
```

## MCP Server WebRTC Integration

We've also enhanced the MCP server integration with WebRTC:

1. **IPFSModel WebRTC Support**:
   - Added `_check_webrtc()` method to verify WebRTC dependency status
   - Implemented `_init_webrtc()` method to initialize the WebRTC streaming manager
   - Added proper handling of WebRTC initialization failures

2. **Centralized Dependency Checking**:
   - Now using `check_webrtc_dependencies()` from webrtc_streaming module for consistent results
   - Added graceful fallback when the function isn't available

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Created `test_mcp_webrtc.py` for verifying MCP server WebRTC integration
   - Test confirms WebRTC manager is properly initialized on server startup
   - Test verifies that dependencies are correctly detected and reported

## Successful Dependency Detection

Our test results now show that WebRTC dependencies are properly detected:

```
WebRTC dependency flags:
HAVE_WEBRTC: True
HAVE_NUMPY: True
HAVE_CV2: True
HAVE_AV: True
HAVE_AIORTC: True
HAVE_WEBSOCKETS: True
HAVE_NOTIFICATIONS: True
```

The MCP server now initializes WebRTC properly:

```
ipfs_kit_py.mcp.models.ipfs_model - INFO - WebRTC dependencies available, initializing WebRTC support
ipfs_kit_py.mcp.models.ipfs_model - INFO - WebRTC streaming manager initialized successfully
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive fix ensures:

1. **Robust Dependency Detection**: Dependencies are properly detected even with module variations or import path differences
2. **Graceful Degradation**: The system works correctly whether dependencies are available or not
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All components agree on WebRTC status throughout the codebase
4. **Clear Installation Instructions**: Users get helpful guidance on how to enable WebRTC
5. **MCP Server Integration**: WebRTC is properly initialized in the MCP server

The fix maintains backward compatibility while significantly improving the reliability of WebRTC functionality detection and initialization.
