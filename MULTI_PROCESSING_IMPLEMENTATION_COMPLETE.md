cli_workers = max(1, total_workers // 4)       # 25% for CLI
```

### Process Pool Configuration
```python
# CPU-intensive operations
process_pool = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers)

# I/O bound operations  
thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers * 2)
```

### Batch Operation Settings
```python
# Optimal batch sizes for different operations
BATCH_SIZE_PIN_OPS = 100      # Pin add/remove operations
BATCH_SIZE_HEALTH = 50        # Health check operations
BATCH_SIZE_CONCURRENT = 20    # Concurrent request limit
```
