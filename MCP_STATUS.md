## Known Issues

1. ~~OAuth implementation may need additional security hardening~~ (FIXED - see OAuth Security Enhancements)
2. ~~The monitoring system uses a significant amount of memory when tracking many metrics~~ (FIXED - see Monitoring Optimizations)
3. ~~API key validation could benefit from caching improvements~~ (FIXED - see API Key Cache Improvements)

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Role-Based Access Control Implementation

A comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system has been implemented to enable fine-grained permission management based on user roles.

- ✅ Role hierarchy with inheritance
- ✅ Permission-based access control
- ✅ Resource-specific access rules
- ✅ Backend-specific permissions
- ✅ Flexible policy enforcement
- ✅ Integration with authentication system
- ✅ Developer-friendly API

- `/ipfs_kit_py/mcp/examples/rbac_example.py`: Example usage and integration with FastAPI

### OAuth Security Enhancements

**Status: COMPLETE**

The OAuth implementation has been significantly hardened with comprehensive security improvements that address common vulnerabilities and implement best practices.

- ✅ PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) implementation for secure authorization code flow
- ✅ Token binding to prevent token theft and misuse across devices/networks
- ✅ Advanced threat detection for identifying and preventing common OAuth attacks 
- ✅ Certificate chain validation for secure connections to OAuth providers
- ✅ Dynamic security policies that adapt based on risk assessment
- ✅ Protection against CSRF, authorization code injection, and token leakage
- ✅ Improved token management with secure token processing
