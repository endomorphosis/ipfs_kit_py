## Current Development Focus (Q2 2025)

### Server Architecture Consolidation (Active - Q2 2025)

The project previously contained two primary MCP server implementations:

1.  **FastAPI-based Server (`ipfs_kit_py/mcp/`)**: A feature-rich implementation containing extensive integrations for IPFS, various storage backends (S3, Filecoin, Storacha, etc.), streaming, search, and advanced features like multi-backend migration.
2.  **Direct Starlette Server (`direct_mcp_server.py`)**: An implementation focused on robust deployment mechanisms (blue/green deployment, live patching with syntax/test validation) and explicit SSE handling.

To resolve complexities from maintaining separate implementations and a previous unsuccessful migration attempt, we are actively consolidating these codebases. The `direct_mcp_server.py` is now the running foundation.

**Current Approach:**

- **Foundation**: `direct_mcp_server.py` is now the active foundational codebase, providing robust deployment and patching infrastructure.
- **Reintegration (In Progress)**: The primary task is the ongoing, careful reintegration of controllers, models, services, and features from the legacy FastAPI-based server (`ipfs_kit_py/mcp/`) into the `direct_mcp_server.py` structure. This includes:
    - IPFS core operations
    - Storage backend controllers and models (S3, Filecoin, Storacha, HuggingFace, Lassie)
    - Unified Storage Manager and Migration Controller logic
    - Streaming (WebSocket, WebRTC) components
    - Search functionality (indexing, vector search)
    - Authentication and monitoring components
- **Component Reuse**: We will aim to reuse as much of the existing FastAPI application logic (controllers, models, services) as possible, adapting them to fit within the Starlette application structure used by `direct_mcp_server.py`. This might involve adapting routing, request/response handling, and dependency injection patterns.

**Goal**: The outcome will be a single, unified MCP server based on `direct_mcp_server.py` that incorporates the full feature set previously developed in the FastAPI implementation, while benefiting from the enhanced deployment and maintenance capabilities. This consolidation is the primary focus for Q2 2025.
