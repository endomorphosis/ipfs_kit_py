# MCP Server Development Roadmap

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the canonical roadmap file. There is another copy in `/docs/mcp_roadmap.md` that should be kept in sync with this file.

## Overview

The Model-Controller-Persistence (MCP) server is a crucial component of the IPFS Kit ecosystem, providing a unified interface for interacting with various distributed storage systems. This roadmap outlines our current achievements, ongoing work, and future plans for enhancing the MCP server's capabilities.

## Current Development Status (Q2 2025)

### Server Architecture Consolidation (Completed - Q2 2025)

The project previously contained fragmented MCP server implementations across `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/`, `ipfs_kit_py/mcp_server/`, and `mcp_extensions/`.

**Consolidation Actions (Completed):**

1.  **Established `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/` as Source of Truth:** This directory now holds the unified MCP server library code.
2.  **Removed Redundant Backups:** Deleted numerous `.bak` files from `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/`.
3.  **Removed Redundant Directories:** Deleted the `ipfs_kit_py/mcp_server/` and `mcp_extensions/` directories as they were found to contain only backups or were empty.

**Outcome & Next Steps**: The MCP server logic is now consolidated within the `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/` directory. The `direct_mcp_server.py` script acts as the primary entry point. **The immediate next step is to reassess and verify the functionality of all integrated features within this new structure.**

### Feature Reassessment & Integration Testing (Completed - Q2 2025)
