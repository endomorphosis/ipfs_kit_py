# Archived Stale Tests

This directory contains test files that were identified as stale or empty during cleanup.

## Archival Criteria
- Empty files (0 bytes)
- Files with minimal content that don't contain actual test logic

These files were moved here instead of being deleted to preserve the repository history
and allow for potential restoration if needed.

## Structure
The directory structure attempts to preserve the original location of archived files:
- `tests/` subdirectory files maintain their relative paths
- Root-level test files are placed directly in this directory
