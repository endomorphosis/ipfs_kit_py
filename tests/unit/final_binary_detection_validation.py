BEFORE (Buggy Logic):
    detect = os.system("which ipfs")
    if len(detect) > 0:    # ❌ WRONG!
        return True        # Thought binary was found
    else:
        return False       # Thought binary was not found

WHY IT WAS WRONG:
- os.system() returns EXIT CODE (0=success, non-zero=failure)
- len(0) = 0, len(1) = 0, len(127) = 0 - all exit codes have len() = 0!
- So len(detect) > 0 was ALWAYS False
- This meant binaries were NEVER detected as installed
- Result: Always downloaded to /tmp even when already installed

AFTER (Fixed Logic):  
    detect = os.system("which ipfs")
    if detect == 0:        # ✅ CORRECT!
        return True        # Binary found - don't download
    else:
        return False       # Binary not found - download needed

NOW IT WORKS:
- Exit code 0 = binary found → don't download
- Exit code non-zero = binary not found → download if needed
- Respects existing installations
- Eliminates redundant downloads
