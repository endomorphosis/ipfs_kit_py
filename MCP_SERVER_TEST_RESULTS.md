# MCP Server Test Results

## Summary

The MCP (Model-Controller-Persistence) server has been successfully fixed to address the import issues with `IPFSSimpleAPI`. The server now starts up correctly and the basic infrastructure is working. However, many controller endpoints are not yet fully implemented or have issues.

## Test Results

### Working Endpoints

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/v0/mcp/health` | ✅ Working | Returns server health status with `success: true` |
| `/api/v0/mcp/daemon/status` | ⚠️ Partial | Works but has underlying function error |
| `/api/v0/mcp/cli/version` | ✅ Working | Returns version information correctly |
| `/api/v0/mcp/debug` | ✅ Working | Returns detailed server information |
| `/api/v0/mcp/operations` | ✅ Working | Shows request and response logs |

### Non-working Endpoints

| Endpoint | Status | Error |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/api/v0/mcp/ipfs/add` | ❌ Error | 422 Unprocessable Entity - Form data handling issue |
| `/api/v0/mcp/ipfs/add_string` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |
| `/api/v0/mcp/cli/command` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |
| `/api/v0/mcp/credentials/list` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |
| `/api/v0/mcp/distributed/status` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |
| `/api/v0/mcp/webrtc/capabilities` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |
| `/api/v0/mcp/fs_journal/status` | ❌ Missing | 404 Not Found - Endpoint not implemented |

## Identified Issues

1. **Method Signature Issue**:
   ```
   ipfs_kit.check_daemon_status() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
   ```
   This suggests a mismatch between how the method is defined and how it's being called.

2. **Form Data Handling**:
   The IPFS add endpoint can't process the multipart form data correctly, resulting in a 422 error.

3. **Missing Endpoints**:
   Many controller endpoints that should be available based on the initialization logs are not properly registered or implemented yet.

4. **Controller Registration**:
   The controller registration process appears to be working, but the actual route handlers might not be implemented correctly for many of the controllers.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Daemon Status Method**:
   Correct the signature of the `check_daemon_status` method to accept the daemon_type parameter correctly.

2. **Implement Form Data Handling**:
   Fix the IPFS add endpoint to properly parse multipart form data for file uploads.

3. **Complete Controller Implementations**:
   Finish implementing the missing endpoints for all controllers, particularly:
   - IPFS controller endpoints (add_string, cat, pin, unpin)
   - CLI controller command execution
   - Credential controller list endpoint
   - Distributed controller status endpoint
   - WebRTC controller capabilities endpoint
   - FS Journal controller status endpoint

4. **Review Route Registration**:
   Check that all controllers are properly registering their routes with consistent path naming.

5. **Add Error Handling Middleware**:
   Implement comprehensive error handling middleware to provide better error responses.

6. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   Once the endpoints are fixed, expand the test script to cover more functionality and edge cases.

## Next Steps

The MCP server is functioning at a basic level with the import issues resolved. The focus should now be on completing the implementation of all controller endpoints and fixing the identified issues before proceeding with further integration testing.
