The foundation for all storage backends will be a BaseStorageModel class that standardizes operations and error handling.

```python
# Template for implementation
class BaseStorageModel:
    """Base model for storage backend operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, kit_instance=None, cache_manager=None, credential_manager=None):
        """Initialize storage model with dependencies."""
        self.kit = kit_instance
        self.cache_manager = cache_manager
        self.credential_manager = credential_manager
        self.operation_stats = self._initialize_stats()
        
    def _initialize_stats(self):
        """Initialize operation statistics tracking."""
        return {
            "upload_count": 0,
            "download_count": 0,
            "list_count": 0,
            "delete_count": 0,
            "total_operations": 0,
            "success_count": 0,
            "failure_count": 0,
            "bytes_uploaded": 0,
            "bytes_downloaded": 0
        }
    
    def get_stats(self):
        """Get current operation statistics."""
        return {
            "operation_stats": self.operation_stats,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }

## Conclusion

This enhancement plan provides a structured approach to increasing test coverage and functionality of the MCP server and ipfs_kit_py library. By implementing storage backend integrations, cross-backend bridge operations, and enhancing testing, we can create a robust and versatile system for managing content across different storage platforms.

The plan prioritizes high-value features while also addressing testing and documentation needs. The implementation follows a consistent pattern for each storage backend, which will facilitate future extensions and maintenance.
