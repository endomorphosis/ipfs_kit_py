# Auto-Healing Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Simple Auto-Heal Workflow (NEW - Recommended)

**File:** `.github/workflows/simple-auto-heal.yml`

This is the main auto-healing workflow that follows the VS Code Copilot pattern:

**Features:**
- ✅ Monitors specified workflows for failures
- ✅ Creates GitHub issue with workflow failure details and logs
- ✅ Creates draft pull request linked to the issue
- ✅ @mentions GitHub Copilot in the PR to trigger the agent
- ✅ Creates context files for Copilot to analyze
- ✅ Avoids duplicate issues (checks for recent similar issues)

**How it works:**
1. When a monitored workflow fails, this workflow triggers
2. It extracts failure details (job logs, error messages, etc.)
3. Creates an issue with all the failure information
4. Creates a new branch with context files
5. Creates a draft PR from that branch
6. @mentions @copilot in the PR description with specific instructions
7. Copilot analyzes and implements a fix
8. You review and merge the fix

**This is the simplest and most effective approach.**

### 2. Fixed Existing Workflows

#### workflow-failure-monitor.yml
- ❌ **DISABLED** (set `if: false`)
- Fixed wildcard issue: workflow_run trigger does not support `["*"]` syntax for monitoring all workflows
- Added explicit workflow names instead
- Marked as deprecated in favor of simple-auto-heal.yml

#### workflow-failure-autofix.yml
- ❌ **DISABLED** (set `if: false`)
- Added clarifying comments
- Marked as deprecated in favor of simple-auto-heal.yml
- Can be re-enabled by removing the `if: false` condition if needed

#### Other workflows unchanged:
- `copilot-agent-autofix.yml` - More complex AI-powered fixes
- `auto-heal-workflow.yml` - Uses Python scripts for fix generation
- `copilot-auto-heal.yml` - Alternative Copilot invocation methods

### 3. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **AUTO_HEAL_README.md** - Full documentation of all auto-healing workflows
- **AUTO_HEAL_SUMMARY.md** - This file, quick implementation summary

## Key Improvements

1. **Simplicity**: `simple-auto-heal.yml` is much simpler than the existing workflows
2. **VS Code Pattern**: Follows the familiar pattern of issue → draft PR → @mention Copilot
3. **No External Python Scripts**: Doesn't rely on custom Python scripts for analysis or fix generation
4. **Better Error Handling**: Includes proper error log extraction
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing issues to avoid spam
6. **Fixed Bugs**: Fixed wildcard workflow monitoring issue (workflow_run doesn't support `["*"]` syntax)

## What Happens When a Workflow Fails

### With simple-auto-heal.yml Enabled:

1. **Failure Detected** → Workflow fails
2. **Issue Created** → Auto-heal creates issue with logs
3. **Branch Created** → New branch with context files
4. **PR Created** → Draft PR with @copilot mention
5. **Copilot Activates** → Copilot receives the @mention
6. **Fix Implemented** → Copilot analyzes and implements fix
7. **Review & Merge** → You review the fix and merge

### Example Issue Created:

```markdown
[Auto-Heal] Workflow Failed: Python Package (Run #123)

# Workflow Failure Detected
...
## Error Logs
...
## Next Steps
A draft pull request will be automatically created...
```

### Example PR Created:

```markdown
[Auto-Heal] Fix Python Package workflow failure

# Auto-Heal: Fix Workflow Failure
...
## GitHub Copilot - Please Help!

@copilot Please analyze this workflow failure and implement a fix:
1. Review the error logs...
2. Identify the root cause...
3. Implement a minimal fix...
```

## Testing

To test the auto-healing:
1. Wait for a workflow to fail naturally, OR
2. Intentionally break a workflow (e.g., introduce a syntax error)
3. Watch for the auto-heal workflow to trigger
4. Check that an issue is created
5. Check that a draft PR is created with @copilot mention
6. Wait for Copilot to respond (if enabled in repository)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. ✅ **Use simple-auto-heal.yml** - It's enabled and ready to go
2. ✅ **Keep workflow-failure-monitor.yml disabled** - Already done
3. ✅ **Keep workflow-failure-autofix.yml disabled** - Already done (to avoid duplicate PRs)
4. ✅ **Monitor the next workflow failure** - Test the system

### Optional Actions:

1. Customize the list of monitored workflows in `simple-auto-heal.yml`
2. Adjust labels for issues/PRs if needed
3. Update or create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with guidance for Copilot (this file already exists and provides instructions for fixing workflow failures)

## Troubleshooting

If auto-healing doesn't work:

1. **Check workflow logs** - See why it failed
2. **Verify permissions** - Ensure the workflow has needed permissions
3. **Check Copilot integration** - Verify Copilot is enabled in repo settings
4. **Review issue/PR** - Check if they were created correctly
