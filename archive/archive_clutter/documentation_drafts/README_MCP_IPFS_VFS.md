# MCP Server with IPFS and VFS Integration

This document describes the comprehensive IPFS and VFS integration in the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

## Overview

The MCP server provides a JSON-RPC interface for interacting with IPFS and the Virtual File System (VFS). It supports both standard MCP endpoints and direct JSON-RPC calls.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- JSON-RPC API with `mcp/execute` method
- Health and initialization endpoints
- Server information and capabilities reporting

### IPFS Tools
- `ipfs_version`: Get IPFS version information
- `ipfs_add`: Add content to IPFS
- `ipfs_cat`: Get content from IPFS using its CID
- MFS Operations:
  - `ipfs_files_mkdir`: Create directories in the MFS
  - `ipfs_files_write`: Write content to files
  - `ipfs_files_ls`: List directory contents
  - `ipfs_files_read`: Read file content
  - `ipfs_files_rm`: Remove files/directories

### Virtual File System (VFS) Tools
- `vfs_mount`: Mount a CID to the virtual filesystem
- `vfs_status`: Check status of virtual filesystem
- `vfs_write`: Write content to the VFS
- `vfs_read`: Read content from the VFS
- `vfs_delete`: Delete files from the VFS

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

1. Fixed the `ipfs_files_ls` command to work correctly without the unsupported `--json` flag
2. Implemented proper result structures for all tools with consistent `success` flag
3. Added `vfs_delete`, `vfs_write`, and `vfs_read` tools
4. Enhanced `ipfs_add` tool to support additional parameters like `filename` and `pin`
5. Fixed content handling in the `ipfs_cat` tool
6. Improved error handling and response formatting

## Testing

The comprehensive test suite validates:
1. All tools are properly registered
2. IPFS commands work correctly
3. VFS operations function as expected
4. Integration between IPFS and VFS is possible

Use the `start_final_solution.sh` script to run the server and comprehensive tests:

```bash
./start_final_solution.sh --verbose
```

Additional options:
- `--test-only`: Only run tests without starting a new server
- `--no-restart`: Don't restart an existing server
- `--verbose`: Show detailed test results
- `--no-fixes`: Don't attempt to apply fixes automatically

## Implementation

The server is implemented in Python using the Starlette framework. Key components:

- `minimal_mcp_server.py`: Core implementation with all tools
- `comprehensive_mcp_test.py`: Test suite for validating functionality
- `start_final_solution.sh`: Orchestration script for setup and testing

## Results

When properly configured, all 11 tests should pass:
- Server health check
- Tool availability check
- JSON-RPC ping
- IPFS version check
- IPFS content operations (add/cat)
- MFS operations
- VFS tool availability
- VFS operations
- IPFS-VFS integration
