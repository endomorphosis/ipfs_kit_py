# Virtual Filesystem MCP Integration Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Virtual Filesystem (VFS) integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Current Status

The Virtual Filesystem integration provides tools for working with a virtual filesystem, IPFS integration, and persistent file tracking through a filesystem journal. These components have been fully implemented but require proper integration with the final MCP server solution.

### Completed Components

1. **Virtual Filesystem Implementation**
   - File in: `enhance_vfs_mcp_integration.py`
   - Contains over 30 tools for filesystem operations, journal tracking, and IPFS integration
   - Tools are fully implemented and functional

2. **Supporting Scripts and Utilities**
   - `vfs_health_monitor.py` - Health monitoring for the MCP server with VFS
   - `vfs_dashboard.py` - Dashboard for monitoring VFS status
   - `vfs_dependency_manager.py` - Dependency management for VFS
   - `install_vfs_dependencies.sh` - Helper script for installing dependencies
   - `restart_mcp_with_vfs.sh` - Helper script for restarting MCP with VFS

3. **Documentation**
   - `README_VFS_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation of VFS tools and usage

### Integration Status

The VFS tools have not yet been integrated into the final MCP server solution. The following integration options are available:

1. **Manual Integration**
   - Add `from enhance_vfs_mcp_integration import register_all_fs_tools` to the MCP server
   - Call `register_all_fs_tools(server)` after server initialization
   - Update Claude MCP settings to include VFS tools

2. **Automated Integration**
   - Run the integration script: `./integrate_vfs_to_final_mcp.py`
   - This will automatically integrate VFS tools into the best available MCP server

3. **Previously Attempted Integration**
   - The `update_mcp_with_vfs_tools.py` script was created but not fully executed
   - This script has been archived in case needed for reference

## Available VFS Tools

The following tools are available after integration:

### File System Operations
- `vfs_list` - List directory contents
- `vfs_read` - Read file contents
- `vfs_write` - Write to a file
- `vfs_mkdir` - Create a directory
- `vfs_rm` - Remove a file or directory
- `vfs_copy` - Copy files or directories
- `vfs_move` - Move files or directories
- `vfs_stat` - Get file or directory information

### Filesystem Journal
- `fs_journal_get_history` - Get operation history for filesystem paths
- `fs_journal_sync` - Synchronize the journal with storage backends
- `fs_journal_track` - Start tracking operations for a path
- `fs_journal_untrack` - Stop tracking operations for a path
- `fs_journal_status` - Get journal status information

### IPFS-FS Bridge
- `ipfs_fs_bridge_status` - Get bridge status
- `ipfs_fs_bridge_sync` - Sync content between IPFS and filesystem
- `ipfs_fs_bridge_map` - Map an IPFS path to a filesystem path
- `ipfs_fs_bridge_unmap` - Remove a mapping
- `ipfs_fs_bridge_list_mappings` - List all mappings
- `ipfs_fs_export_to_ipfs` - Export from filesystem to IPFS
- `ipfs_fs_import_from_ipfs` - Import from IPFS to filesystem

### Storage Backend Tools
- `init_ipfs_backend` - Initialize IPFS backend
- `init_filecoin_backend` - Initialize Filecoin backend
- `init_s3_backend` - Initialize S3 backend
- `storage_status` - Check storage backend status
- `storage_transfer` - Transfer between storage backends

## Integration Instructions

To integrate the VFS tools into the final MCP solution:

1. Run the integration script:
   ```bash
   ./integrate_vfs_to_final_mcp.py
   ```

2. Start the MCP server with VFS integration:
   ```bash
   ./restart_mcp_with_vfs.sh
   ```

3. Test that the tools are working:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/jsonrpc \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"get_tools","id":1}'
   ```
   The response should include all VFS tools.

## Archived Components

Previous versions of the VFS integration files have been archived in:
```
/home/barberb/ipfs_kit_py/archive/vfs_integration/
```

These files are kept for reference but the active development should use the current versions in the main directory.
