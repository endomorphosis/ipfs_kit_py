# Fixed MCP Server with 53+ Model Support

This directory contains scripts and tools to fix and enhance the MCP server that previously worked with 53+ models. This README explains the problem, the solution approach, and how to use the scripts to restore and improve functionality.

## Problem Overview

The `start_final_mcp_server.sh` script used to work with approximately 53 models but stopped functioning correctly. The goal was to:

1. Fix the underlying issues causing the script to fail
2. Restore support for all 53+ models
3. Merge features from other experimental implementations into the final MCP server
4. Provide better error handling and diagnostics

## Solution Components

### Verification Tool

`verify_fixed_mcp_tools.py` is a verification script that checks if the MCP server is working correctly by:
- Verifying server health status
- Testing JSON-RPC functionality
- Checking for all expected tools and models (at least 53)
- Generating a comprehensive report

### Feature Integration

`integrate_features.py` identifies, extracts, and merges features from various MCP server implementations:
- Identifies tool definitions, model classes, endpoints, and API functions
- Extracts them from multiple source files
- Merges them into a single, enhanced implementation
- Preserves backward compatibility

### Python Launcher

`start_final_mcp.py` is a Python launcher that:
- Handles compatibility issues
- Applies necessary module patches
- Ensures proper Python path setup
- Runs the best available server implementation
- Provides better error handling and logging

### Enhanced Startup Script

`start_enhanced_mcp_server.sh` is a shell script that:
- Provides advanced error handling and diagnostics
- Checks for required dependencies
- Stops any running servers before starting a new one
- Verifies server operation after startup
- Runs feature integration if needed

## Usage Instructions

### Verifying Server Operation

To check if the server is working with all 53+ models:

```bash
./verify_fixed_mcp_tools.py
```

Additional options:
```bash
./verify_fixed_mcp_tools.py --host localhost --port 3000 --output verification_report.json
```

### Integrating Features

To integrate features from different implementations:

```bash
./integrate_features.py
```

This will merge features into `fixed_final_mcp_server.py` by default. To specify a different output file:

```bash
./integrate_features.py --output custom_server.py
```

### Starting the Enhanced MCP Server

To start the enhanced MCP server with all fixes and features:

```bash
./start_enhanced_mcp_server.sh
```

Additional options:
```bash
./start_enhanced_mcp_server.sh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --no-integration
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs in the `logs` directory
2. Run the verification script to identify specific problems
3. Examine `integrate_features.log` if feature integration failed
4. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   - Python 3.7+ 
   - Required modules: starlette, uvicorn, fastapi, jsonrpc, asyncio, aiohttp
   - IPFS daemon (optional, but needed for IPFS-related functionality)

## Architecture

The solution uses a modular approach:

1. The enhanced startup script acts as the main entry point
2. It can invoke the feature integration script if needed
3. It launches the Python server launcher
4. The launcher finds and runs the best available server implementation
5. The verification script can be used to confirm proper operation

This approach provides maximum flexibility and resilience.

## Maintenance

To maintain and extend this solution:

1. When adding new models, update the `EXPECTED_CATEGORIES` in the verification script
2. Add new feature files to the `FEATURE_SOURCES` list in the integration script
3. If adding new dependencies, update the `REQUIRED_MODULES` list in both the launcher and startup script

## Backup and Recovery

- Original files are backed up in the `backup_files` directory
- Applied patches are stored in `applied_patches` directory
- The launcher will automatically use the best available implementation
