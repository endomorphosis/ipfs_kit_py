# MCP Server Tools Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to the MCP Server to ensure all tools and endpoints function correctly.

## Overview of the Problem

The MCP server was experiencing issues with the following endpoints:
- Missing IPFS controller endpoints (404 errors)
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint was not accessible via the API prefix, causing 404 errors
- No tools or resources defined in the Claude MCP extension settings
- Storage backend endpoints were functioning correctly but could be improved

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom IPFS Router Extensions

We created a new module `ipfs_router_extensions.py` that contains direct implementations of IPFS endpoints using the FastAPI router system. This module:
- Provides implementations for key IPFS commands like `version`, `add`, `cat`, and pin management
- Uses direct subprocess calls to the IPFS CLI for reliable functionality
- Registers these endpoints under the `/api/v0/ipfs/` prefix

### 2. Enhanced MCP Server

We modified the `enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py` file to:
- Create a simplified MCPServer class that replaces the original unavailable one
- Register controllers and models properly
- Import and use the IPFS and storage backend routers from both:
  - `mcp_extensions.py` for storage backends
  - `ipfs_router_extensions.py` for IPFS operations
- Register the SSE endpoint at both root (`/sse`) and API prefix (`/api/v0/sse`) paths

### 3. Claude MCP Extension Configuration

We created tools to properly configure the Claude MCP extension:
- `update_cline_mcp_config.py`: Updates basic server configuration
- `fix_cline_mcp_tools.py`: Adds tools and resources definitions with proper URIs
- Added 5 tools and 1 resource to the configuration:
  ```
  Tools:
  - ipfs_add: Add content to IPFS
  - ipfs_cat: Get content from IPFS by CID
  - ipfs_pin: Pin content in IPFS by CID
  - ipfs_pin_ls: List pinned content in IPFS
  - storage_status: Get status of all storage backends
  
  Resources:
  - ipfs_content: Access content from IPFS
  ```

### 4. Verification Tools

We created verification scripts to test all aspects of the server:
- `verify_mcp_tools_fixed.py`: Tests API endpoints systematically
- `verify_sse_endpoints.py`: Specifically tests the SSE endpoints

### 5. Simplified Startup

We created a comprehensive start script:
- `start_fixed_mcp_server.sh`: All-in-one script that:
  - Stops any existing MCP servers
  - Starts the enhanced MCP server
  - Updates the Claude MCP extension configuration
  - Runs verification tests
  - Displays a summary of available tools and resources

## Tests Performed

The following endpoints were tested and confirmed working:

### Storage Backends
- `/api/v0/huggingface/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/s3/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/filecoin/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/storacha/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/lassie/status` - ✅ Working

### IPFS Endpoints
- `/api/v0/ipfs/version` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/ipfs/pin/ls` - ✅ Working

### Event Streaming
- `/api/v0/sse` - ✅ Working (fixed SSE endpoint)
- `/sse` - ✅ Working (original SSE endpoint)

## Running the Server

To run the fixed MCP server with all enhancements:

```bash
./start_fixed_mcp_server.sh
```

This will:
1. Start the enhanced MCP server
2. Configure the Claude MCP extension with tools and resources
3. Run verification tests
4. Display available tools and resources

Alternatively, you can run the server manually:

```bash
python enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py --port 9997 --debug
```

And then configure the tools:

```bash
python fix_cline_mcp_tools.py
```

## Verifying Functionality

To verify the server is functioning correctly:

```bash
python verify_mcp_tools_fixed.py
python verify_sse_endpoints.py
```

## Architecture

The solution follows a modular architecture:

1. **Core Server** (`enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py`): Initializes FastAPI app, registers models and controllers
2. **Storage Extensions** (`mcp_extensions.py`): Provides storage backend routes for various services
3. **IPFS Extensions** (`ipfs_router_extensions.py`): Implements IPFS-specific functionality
4. **SSE Endpoints**: Server-Sent Events endpoints provided at both root `/sse` and API prefixed `/api/v0/sse` paths
5. **Tools Configuration** (`fix_cline_mcp_tools.py`): Defines usable tools and resources for Claude
6. **Verification Tools**: Test and validate all aspects of the server
7. **Startup Script** (`start_fixed_mcp_server.sh`): Simplifies the process of setting everything up

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing IPFS Endpoints
Created an extension module to directly implement IPFS endpoints using the FastAPI router system, bypassing the original IPFS controller implementation issues.

### 2. SSE 404 Error
The SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint was only available at the root path `/sse`, causing 404 errors when clients tried to access it through the API prefix path `/api/v0/sse`. We fixed this by:
- Refactoring the SSE handler into a reusable function
- Registering the SSE handler at both the root path and the API prefix path
- This ensures the SSE endpoint is accessible via both `/sse` and `/api/v0/sse`

### 3. Missing MCP Tools and Resources
The Claude MCP extension had no tools or resources defined in its configuration. We fixed this by:
- Creating `fix_cline_mcp_tools.py` to properly define the tools and resources
- Adding URIs for each tool that map to specific server endpoints
- Defining input schemas for each tool to guide Claude in using them correctly
- Adding a resource for accessing IPFS content

This approach ensures a clean separation of concerns and allows for easy maintenance and extension.
