# Utility Scripts

This directory contains various utility scripts for the ipfs_kit_py project. These scripts assist with development, debugging, checking, and other maintenance tasks.

## Directory Structure

- **check/**: Scripts for checking and validating various components  
- **debug/**: Scripts for debugging and troubleshooting
- **add_tools/**: Tools for adding new functionality and components
- **maintenance/**: Maintenance scripts and cleanup utilities
- **verify/**: Verification and validation scripts

## Purpose

These utilities are developer tools that were previously scattered in the root directory. They've been organized here to:

1. Keep the root directory clean
2. Organize tools by their purpose
3. Maintain a clear separation between utility scripts and the main codebase

These scripts are not part of the formal test suite and are primarily meant to be run directly during development or troubleshooting.
