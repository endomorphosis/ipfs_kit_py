## üöÄ Key Implementation: Log Aggregation System

### **Problem Solved**
- ‚ùå **Removed:** `ipfs-kit wal` command
- ‚ùå **Removed:** `ipfs-kit fs-journal` command  
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Unified `ipfs-kit log` with comprehensive subcommands

### **New Functionality**
```bash
# Unified log viewing across all components
ipfs-kit log show                              # View recent logs
ipfs-kit log show --component daemon --level error --since 1h
ipfs-kit log stats --hours 24                 # Log statistics
ipfs-kit log clear --older-than 7d           # Clean up old logs
ipfs-kit log export --format json --since 24h # Export logs
```

### **Component Coverage**
- **daemon**: Core IPFS-Kit operations
- **wal**: Write-ahead log operations
- **fs_journal**: Filesystem journal events  
- **bucket**: Storage bucket operations
- **health**: Health monitoring events
- **replication**: Content replication activities
- **backends**: Storage backend operations
- **pin**: Pin management operations
- **config**: Configuration changes
