## Analysis

### Real API vs. Simulation

This test suite executed 15 operations, with 2 operations (13.3%) using the real Lotus API and 0 operations using simulation mode.

### API Coverage

The test suite covers the following API categories:
- Daemon Management: Starting, stopping, and status checking
- Chain Operations: Retrieving chain head and processing chain messages
- Wallet Operations: Listing, creating, and checking balances
- Miner Operations: Listing miners
- Deal Operations: Listing deals
- File Operations: Importing, listing imports, and retrieving files
- Network Operations: Listing peers

### Daemon Management

The automatic daemon management feature was not successfully verified. The daemon was not running at the start of tests.

## Conclusions

The Lotus integration in ipfs_kit_py is partially functional with real API operations. Some test operations completed successfully.

The system is successfully using the real Lotus daemon API.

### Recommendations

1. Expand real API coverage for more comprehensive testing.
2. Improve error handling and recovery for failed operations.
3. Consider adding simulation tests for edge cases.
4. Focus on stabilizing daemon management.
