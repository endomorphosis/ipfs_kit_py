# MCP Server Project: Final Solution

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation, focusing on the refactored solutions to fix JSON-RPC related issues and ensure reliable functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. `final_mcp_server.py`

The main MCP server implementation with:
- JSON-RPC endpoint for tool execution
- Health check endpoint
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper method implementations for `ping`, `get_tools`, `list_tools`, and `get_server_info`
- Special handling for the asynchronous `use_tool` method

### 2. Testing Tools

Several testing scripts have been developed to validate the server's functionality:

- **enhanced_jsonrpc_test.py** - Detailed tests for JSON-RPC endpoints with comprehensive diagnostics
- **test_mcp_server.py** - Robust server testing with proper startup/shutdown handling
- **simple_mcp_tester.py** - Lightweight testing script for quick verification

### 3. Management Scripts

- **run_final_mcp_solution.sh** - Simplified launcher script to reliably start/stop the server and run tests
- **start_final_solution.sh** - Original (more complex) testing framework for comprehensive verification

## Key Fixes

1. **JSON-RPC Implementation**
   - Fixed synchronous method handling for `ping`, `get_tools`, and `get_server_info`
   - Added special handling for asynchronous `use_tool` in the `handle_jsonrpc` function
   - Added proper method resolution for `list_tools` as an alias to `get_tools`
   - Fixed response formatting to match test runner expectations (returning `{"tools": [...]}` format)

2. **Server Robustness**
   - Added port availability checking to prevent address-in-use errors
   - Improved error handling and timeouts to prevent hanging
   - Enhanced diagnostic logging to better identify issues
   - Added graceful shutdown handling

3. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Created multiple testing scripts with different complexity levels
   - Added result logging for better debugging
   - Implemented health checks before running tests

## Usage

### Basic Server Start

To start the MCP server with standard configuration:

```bash
./run_final_mcp_solution.sh
```

### Server Management

Check server status:
```bash
./run_final_mcp_solution.sh --status
```

Stop the server:
```bash
./run_final_mcp_solution.sh --stop
```

Run tests against a running server:
```bash
./run_final_mcp_solution.sh --test-only
```

### Custom Configuration

Start with custom port and host:
```bash
./run_final_mcp_solution.sh --port 8080 --host 127.0.0.1
```

### Comprehensive Testing

For full testing framework:
```bash
./start_final_solution.sh
```

## Server Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check endpoint |
| `/jsonrpc` | POST | JSON-RPC endpoint for tool invocation |
| `/tools` | GET | Lists available tools |

## Registered Tools

The server exposes numerous IPFS and filesystem tools including:

- IPFS core operations (MFS, DAG, etc.)
- Filesystem journal operations
- Multi-backend storage integrations
- Filecoin and Storacha integrations
- WebRTC and peer-to-peer connectivity tools

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Server fails to start**
   - Check if port is already in use (use `--port` to specify different port)
   - Examine `mcp_server.log` for detailed error messages
   - Ensure Python dependencies are installed

2. **JSON-RPC endpoint not responding**
   - Verify server is running (`--status`)
   - Check health endpoint is accessible
   - Review server logs for JSON-RPC related errors

3. **Tests failing**
   - Check tool registration in server logs
   - Verify response formats match expectations
   - Run with `--test-only` for isolated testing

## Integration with VS Code

The MCP server is designed to integrate with VS Code through:
- JSON-RPC endpoint for tool execution
- Standardized tool response formatting

Use `check_vscode_integration.py` to verify proper integration.

## Going Forward

Future improvements might include:
- Additional tool parameter validation
- More robust error reporting
- Extended test coverage for edge cases
- Enhanced VS Code integration
