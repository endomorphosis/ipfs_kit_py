# IPFS Kit MCP Integration

This document provides information about the integration of IPFS Kit with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI models like Claude to interact with IPFS through standardized tools.

## Overview

We've successfully created the infrastructure needed to expose IPFS Kit's functionality through MCP tools:

1. **Virtual Filesystem Bridge** (`fs_journal_tools.py`): Provides a bridge between IPFS and a virtual filesystem.
2. **VSCode MCP Extension Configuration** (`vscode_mcp_extension.py`): Configures the VSCode Claude extension to recognize IPFS tools.
3. **Testing Tools** (`test_mcp_direct.sh`, `working_example.py`): Help diagnose and demonstrate MCP tool functionality.
4. **Enhanced Tool Definitions** (`enhance_mcp_tools.py`): Defines additional IPFS-related tools for MCP.
5. **Server Startup Script** (`start_ipfs_mcp_with_fs.sh`): Manages the MCP server with IPFS integration.

## Current Status

- ✅ VS Code MCP Extension Configuration: Successfully updated with all tool definitions
- ✅ Core Tool Infrastructure: Created and properly structured
- ✅ Basic Tools Working: The `list_files` tool is functional through MCP
- ❌ IPFS-specific Tools: Currently returning 404 errors (server implementation mismatch)

## Diagnosis

The MCP server advertises IPFS tools in its capabilities (`/initialize` endpoint), but returns 404 errors when tools are called through the `/mcp/tools` endpoint. This suggests:

1. The tools are registered for advertisement but not fully implemented
2. The endpoint path may have changed from what's expected
3. There may be a middleware issue affecting MCP tool requests

## Next Steps

To complete the integration, the following tasks are needed:

1. **Fix MCP Server Endpoint**: Update the MCP server to properly handle `/mcp/tools` requests by:
   - Verifying the routing in `server_bridge.py`
   - Ensuring the IPFS controller is properly registered
   - Adding error handling for tool requests

2. **Implement Missing Methods**: Several methods are reported as missing in the logs:
   ```
   Method add_content not found in extensions module
   Method cat not found in extensions module
   Method pin_add not found in extensions module
   ```
   These need to be implemented in the appropriate extension modules.

3. **Connect Tool Definitions to Implementation**: Ensure the tools defined in VS Code settings match the actual implementation.

4. **Enhanced Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for each tool to verify functionality.

## Implementation Guide

The following files need to be updated:

1. `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/server_bridge.py`: Fix routing for tool requests
2. `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/models/ipfs_model_initializer.py`: Implement missing methods
3. `ipfs_kit_py/mcp/controllers/ipfs_controller.py`: Connect to tool handling

A new file can be created to implement the missing methods:
```python
# ipfs_extensions.py
def add_content(self, content, filename=None, pin=True):
    """Add content to IPFS."""
    # Implementation here
    
def cat(self, cid):
    """Retrieve content from IPFS."""
    # Implementation here
    
def pin_add(self, cid, recursive=True):
    """Pin content to IPFS."""
    # Implementation here
```

## Configuration Guide

The VSCode MCP extension has been configured with the correct tool schemas. After implementing the server-side functionality, you'll need to:

1. Restart the MCP server
2. Restart VS Code to apply all changes
3. Test the tools using the provided example scripts

## Tool List

The following tools have been configured in VSCode's MCP extension:

| Tool Name | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| ipfs_add | Add content to IPFS | Pending |
| ipfs_cat | Retrieve content from IPFS | Pending |
| ipfs_pin | Pin content to local node | Pending |
| ipfs_files_ls | List files in MFS | Pending |
| ipfs_files_mkdir | Create directory in MFS | Pending |
| ipfs_files_read | Read file from MFS | Pending |
| ipfs_files_write | Write file to MFS | Pending |
| list_files | List files in local filesystem | Working |
| read_file | Read file from local filesystem | Pending |
| write_file | Write to local filesystem | Pending |
