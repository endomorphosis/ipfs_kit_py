# 🎯 Set Up Your GitHub Actions Runner - FIXED!

The APT repository warnings have been fixed. Here's how to set up your runner:

## 🚀 **Easiest Way: Interactive Setup**

```bash
./setup-runner-interactive.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ **Guide you step-by-step** through getting a GitHub token
- ✅ **Show you exactly what to do** at each step  
- ✅ **Handle all the setup automatically**
- ✅ **Check if a runner already exists**

---

## �� **Alternative: Direct Setup**

If you already have your GitHub token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
./scripts/setup-github-runner.sh
```

---

## 🔑 **Getting Your GitHub Token**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: `GitHub Actions Runner`
4. Select scopes:
   - ☑️ `repo` (all sub-scopes)
   - ☑️ `workflow`
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)

---

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

The script now:
- ✅ Handles APT repository warnings gracefully
- ✅ Skips dependency installation if already installed
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Won't fail due to third-party repo issues

---

## 📋 **What Happens When You Run It**

1. Detects your AMD64 architecture ✓
2. Checks/installs dependencies (curl, jq, etc.) ✓
3. Downloads GitHub Actions runner ✓
4. Registers with your repository ✓
5. Installs as a systemd service ✓
6. Starts automatically ✓

---

## 🎉 **After Setup**

Your workflows will start running:
- `amd64-ci.yml` - AMD64 CI/CD Pipeline
- `multi-arch-ci.yml` - AMD64 native tests

Check status:
```bash
./scripts/list-runners.sh
```

Monitor in real-time:
```bash
./scripts/monitor-runner.sh
```

---

## ⚠️ **Important**

The error you saw was just from APT repository warnings (Stripe, Keybase, etc.).
These are NOT critical - the runner setup will work fine!

The script now ignores these warnings and focuses on what matters.

---

**Ready? Run this:**

```bash
./setup-runner-interactive.sh
```

It will guide you through everything!
