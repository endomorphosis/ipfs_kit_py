## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This PR Does
✅ **Provides complete documentation**
✅ **Analyzes source repository**
✅ **Creates integration strategy**
✅ **Estimates timeline and effort**
✅ **Identifies priorities**

### What This PR Does NOT Do
❌ **Does not implement any automation** - Implementation is Phase 2+
❌ **Does not modify workflows** - Only planning documentation
❌ **Does not add Python scripts** - Scripts will be added in Phase 1
❌ **Does not add VS Code tasks** - Tasks will be added in Phase 4

**This is a planning and documentation PR only.**
