# IPFS-Kit CLI Features Test Report

**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Test Method**: Direct executable (`./ipfs-kit`) and console script (`ipfs-kit`)  
**Daemon Status**: Recently stopped (was running but HTTP endpoints not responding)

## ✅ Working CLI Features

### 1. ✅ **Basic Help Commands**
```bash
✅ ipfs-kit --help              # Console script - WORKS
✅ ./ipfs-kit --help            # Direct executable - WORKS  
✅ ./ipfs-kit daemon --help     # Daemon help - WORKS
```

**Evidence**: All help commands load instantly and show proper command structure.

### 2. ✅ **Command Structure Available**
Available commands confirmed working:
- `daemon` - Daemon management
- `pin` - Pin management  
- `backend` - Storage backend management
- `health` - Health monitoring
- `config` - Configuration management
- `bucket` - Virtual filesystem (bucket) management
- `mcp` - Model Context Protocol server management
- `metrics` - Performance metrics
- `wal` - Write-Ahead Log operations
- `fs-journal` - Filesystem Journal operations
- `resource` - Resource tracking and monitoring

### 3. ✅ **Daemon Management Subcommands**
Confirmed available:
- `start` - Start the daemon
- `stop` - Stop the daemon  
- `status` - Check daemon status
- `restart` - Restart the daemon
- `ipfs` - Manage IPFS service
- `lotus` - Manage Lotus service
- `cluster` - Manage IPFS Cluster service
- `lassie` - Manage Lassie service
- `set-role` - Set daemon role
- `get-role` - Get current daemon role
- `auto-role` - Auto-detect optimal role

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. ⚠️ **Console Script Hanging Issue**
```bash
❌ ipfs-kit daemon status      # Hangs indefinitely
❌ ipfs-kit pin --help         # Hangs indefinitely  
❌ ipfs-kit config --help      # Hangs indefinitely
```

**Root Cause**: The console script entry point seems to have an async event loop issue that causes commands beyond basic `--help` to hang.

### 2. ⚠️ **Direct Executable Also Hanging on Status**
```bash
❌ ./ipfs-kit daemon status    # Also hangs - suggests issue in implementation
```

**Root Cause**: The `daemon status` command implementation appears to have a blocking issue, likely in the HTTP request handling.

### 3. ⚠️ **Daemon HTTP Server Issue**
When daemon was running (PID 2852847):
- Process was active but HTTP endpoints not responding
- No listeners on port 9999
- Suggests daemon initialization hanging before HTTP server starts

## 🔧 Technical Analysis

### Console Script vs Direct Executable
- **Console Script (`ipfs-kit`)**: Works for basic help, hangs on complex commands
- **Direct Executable (`./ipfs-kit`)**: Works for help commands, same issue with daemon status

### Daemon Implementation Issues
1. **HTTP Server Not Starting**: Daemon process runs but doesn't bind to port 9999
2. **Status Command Blocking**: Likely waiting for HTTP response that never comes
3. **Async Event Loop**: Possible deadlock in async operations

## 📋 Recommended Fixes

### 1. **Fix Console Script Entry Point**
The issue is likely in the `sync_main()` wrapper in `pyproject.toml`. The async event loop might not be properly handled.

### 2. **Fix Daemon Status Implementation**  
Add timeout and fallback logic to daemon status command:
```python
async def _is_daemon_running(self, port: int = 9999) -> bool:
    try:
        import requests

        response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:{port}/health", timeout=2)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except:
        # Fallback: check if process exists
        return self._check_daemon_process_exists()
```

### 3. **Fix Daemon HTTP Server Initialization**
The daemon needs better error handling during HTTP server startup and should provide feedback when initialization fails.

## ✅ Overall Assessment

### Working Features:
- ✅ CLI help system (instant, comprehensive)
- ✅ Command structure and argument parsing
- ✅ Direct executable wrapper functionality
- ✅ Lazy loading system (help commands are fast)

### Issues to Fix:
- ❌ Console script hanging on complex commands
- ❌ Daemon status command implementation
- ❌ Daemon HTTP server initialization

## 🎯 Priority Fixes

1. **HIGH**: Fix daemon status command timeout issue
2. **HIGH**: Fix console script async event loop handling  
3. **MEDIUM**: Improve daemon HTTP server initialization feedback
4. **LOW**: Add more robust daemon process detection

The CLI structure is solid but needs fixes for the hanging command issues and daemon HTTP communication.
