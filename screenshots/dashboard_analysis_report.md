## Conclusion

The dashboard is working correctly and matches the PR #38 specifications. The issue was **missing Python dependencies** (fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, psutil) that prevented the dashboard from starting, not broken paths or CSS issues from the PR #39 reorganization.

All visual elements, styling, and functionality are present and working as expected. The reorganization in PR #39 did not break the dashboard - it was simply a dependency installation issue.

## Screenshots Evidence

The saved PNG screenshot (`dashboard_actual.png`) provides visual proof that the dashboard renders correctly with:
- Proper light theme
- "ðŸš€ IPFS Kit" header
- Professional card-based layout
- Responsive design elements

This resolves the reported issues and confirms the dashboard is fully operational.
