## Conclusion

The AnyIO migration is nearly complete (~99.5%) with all critical components successfully migrated. The MCP server now fully supports both asyncio and trio backends while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. All controllers, models, and core functionality have been migrated to use AnyIO primitives, providing greater flexibility and resilience.

The comprehensive migration has been complemented with detailed documentation, including performance comparisons between backends and example code demonstrating how to use the AnyIO-based components. The examples include backend selection capability, allowing users to choose the async library that best fits their use case.

Only a few minor tasks remain, primarily related to CI/CD pipeline updates, advanced monitoring for backend-specific metrics, and final integration tests. The migration has been a comprehensive success, fully modernizing the codebase to support the evolving Python async ecosystem.

The project now benefits from:
- Greater flexibility with support for multiple async backends
- Improved code structure with AnyIO's modern patterns
- Enhanced error handling and cancellation behavior
- Better maintainability with backend-agnostic code
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Detailed performance analysis to guide backend selection
- Future-proofing against changes in Python's async ecosystem

This successful migration positions the project well for future enhancements and ensures compatibility with a broader range of async libraries and frameworks.
