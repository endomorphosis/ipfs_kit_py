# MCP Tools Fixes Documentation

This document provides information about the fixes implemented to ensure all MCP server tools work correctly.

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides a set of tools for interacting with IPFS and other storage backends. These tools are exposed via a REST API and can be used by clients such as Cline. The MCP server was missing implementations for some of the methods required by these tools, which have now been added.

## Implemented Fixes

The following files have been created or modified to fix the MCP server tools:

1. **ipfs_kit_py/mcp/models/ipfs_model_extensions.py** - Contains implementations for all the missing IPFS model methods:
   - `add_content` - Add content to IPFS
   - `cat` - Retrieve content from IPFS by CID
   - `pin_add` - Pin content to IPFS
   - `pin_rm` - Unpin content from IPFS
   - `pin_ls` - List pinned content
   - `swarm_peers` - List connected peers
   - `swarm_connect` - Connect to a peer
   - `swarm_disconnect` - Disconnect from a peer
   - `storage_transfer` - Transfer content between storage backends
   - `get_version` - Get IPFS version information

2. **ipfs_kit_py/mcp/models/ipfs_model_initializer.py** - Initializes the IPFS model with the extensions.

3. **ipfs_kit_py/mcp/run_mcp_server_initializer.py** - Patches the MCP server to initialize the IPFS model extensions during startup.

4. **ipfs_kit_py/mcp/sse_cors_fix.py** - Fixes SSE (Server-Sent Events) and CORS issues to ensure proper communication with Cline.

5. **verify_mcp_compatibility.py** - Updated to check and apply the IPFS model extensions and SSE/CORS fixes.

6. **start_mcp_server_fixed.sh** - Updated to explicitly initialize the extensions during server startup.

7. **test_mcp_tools.py** - Test script to verify all extensions and tools work correctly.

8. **verify_mcp_tools.sh** - Convenience script to automate the verification process.

## Available MCP Tools

The following MCP tools are now available:

1. **ipfs_add** - Add content to IPFS
   - Input: `{"content": "string", "pin": boolean}`
   - Output: `{"cid": "string", "size": number}`

2. **ipfs_cat** - Retrieve content from IPFS
   - Input: `{"cid": "string"}`
   - Output: `{"content": "string"}`

3. **ipfs_pin** - Pin content in IPFS
   - Input: `{"cid": "string"}`
   - Output: `{"success": boolean}`

4. **storage_transfer** - Transfer content between storage backends
   - Input: `{"source": "string", "destination": "string", "identifier": "string"}`
   - Output: `{"success": boolean, "destinationId": "string"}`

## Verification

To verify that all the MCP server tools are working correctly, run the `verify_mcp_tools.sh` script:

```bash
./verify_mcp_tools.sh
```

This script will:
1. Run the MCP compatibility verification
2. Test the IPFS model extensions
3. Test the Cline MCP integration
4. Start the MCP server if it's not already running
5. Test the MCP server API
6. Stop the test server if it was started

If all tests pass, the MCP server tools are working correctly.

## Usage

To start the MCP server with all tools enabled, run:

```bash
./start_mcp_server_fixed.sh
```

The MCP server will start on port 9994 by default. You can access the API at:

```
http://localhost:9994/api/v0
```

## Cline Integration

The MCP server is automatically configured to integrate with Cline. The configuration file is located at:

```
.config/Code - Insiders/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
```

This file defines the MCP server URL, available tools, and input/output schemas.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the MCP server tools, check the following:

1. Make sure the MCP server is running: `./start_mcp_server_fixed.sh`
2. Check the logs in `mcp_server.log` and `logs/mcp_server_stdout.log`
3. Run the verification script: `./verify_mcp_tools.sh`
4. If specific tools are not working, check the API responses for more details

## Architecture

The MCP server follows a Model-Controller architecture:

1. **Models** (e.g., IPFSModel) - Handle the business logic and interactions with IPFS and other storage backends
2. **Controllers** (e.g., IPFSController) - Handle HTTP requests and responses, and delegate to the models

The extensions we've added primarily focus on the model layer, providing implementations for methods that were previously missing or incomplete.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future improvements include:

1. Adding more comprehensive error handling
2. Implementing additional storage backends
3. Adding authentication and authorization
4. Improving performance with caching
5. Adding more advanced IPFS operations (e.g., pubsub, DHT)
