# MCP Server Tools Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to the MCP Server to ensure all tools and endpoints function correctly.

## Overview of the Problem

The MCP server was experiencing issues with the following endpoints:
- Missing IPFS controller endpoints (404 errors)
- Storage backend endpoints were functioning correctly but could be improved

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom IPFS Router Extensions

We created a new module `ipfs_router_extensions.py` that contains direct implementations of IPFS endpoints using the FastAPI router system. This module:
- Provides implementations for key IPFS commands like `version`, `add`, `cat`, and pin management
- Uses direct subprocess calls to the IPFS CLI for reliable functionality
- Registers these endpoints under the `/api/v0/ipfs/` prefix

### 2. Enhanced MCP Server

We modified the `enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py` file to:
- Create a simplified MCPServer class that replaces the original unavailable one
- Register controllers and models properly
- Import and use the IPFS and storage backend routers from both:
  - `mcp_extensions.py` for storage backends
  - `ipfs_router_extensions.py` for IPFS operations

### 3. Verification Tools

We created a verification script `verify_mcp_tools_fixed.py` that:
- Tests all server endpoints systematically
- Verifies storage backend status endpoints
- Confirms IPFS endpoint functionality

## Tests Performed

The following endpoints were tested and confirmed working:

### Storage Backends
- `/api/v0/huggingface/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/s3/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/filecoin/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/storacha/status` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/lassie/status` - ✅ Working

### IPFS Endpoints
- `/api/v0/ipfs/version` - ✅ Working
- `/api/v0/ipfs/pin/ls` - ✅ Working

## Running the Server

To run the fixed MCP server:

```bash
python enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py --port 9997 --debug
```

## Verifying Functionality

To verify the server is functioning correctly:

```bash
python verify_mcp_tools_fixed.py
```

## Architecture

The solution follows a modular architecture:

1. **Core Server** (`enhanced_mcp_server_fixed.py`): Initializes FastAPI app, registers models and controllers
2. **Storage Extensions** (`mcp_extensions.py`): Provides storage backend routes for various services
3. **IPFS Extensions** (`ipfs_router_extensions.py`): Implements IPFS-specific functionality
4. **Verification Tool** (`verify_mcp_tools_fixed.py`): Tests and validates endpoint functionality

This approach ensures a clean separation of concerns and allows for easy maintenance and extension.
