## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Sudo Configuration
- ✅ Created `/etc/sudoers.d/github-actions-endomorphosis` for passwordless CI/CD operations
- ✅ Permissions set to 0440 (validated with `visudo -c`)
- ✅ Allows common CI/CD commands: apt-get, docker, systemctl, etc.

### 2. MCP Dashboard Validation
- ✅ MCP server running successfully on port 8004
- ✅ 94 tools available and functioning
- ✅ All API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Dashboard accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8004

## Test Results

### ARM64 CI/CD Functionality Test
- ✅ Architecture: aarch64
- ✅ Package import successful
- ✅ CLI help command successful  
- ✅ MCP status command successful
- ✅ All ARM64 CI/CD tests passed

### System Health
- ✅ CPU Usage: 2.7%
- ✅ Memory Usage: 15.1% (19.4GB / 128.5GB)
- ✅ Python Version: 3.12.11
- ✅ Data Directory: /home/barberb/.ipfs_kit

## Automatic Startup Verification

All runners are configured to start automatically with systemctl:

```bash
systemctl is-enabled actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_kit_py.arm64-dgx-spark.service
# Output: enabled

systemctl is-enabled actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.arm64-dgx-spark-gb10-ipfs.service  
# Output: enabled

systemctl is-enabled actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_datasets_py.arm64-dgx-spark-gb10-datasets.service
# Output: enabled

systemctl is-enabled github-actions-runner.service
# Output: enabled
```

## Conclusion

The GitHub Actions runners were actually working correctly and **did restart automatically when the machine restarted**. The runners have been running continuously for 3 days since the last restart on October 24th. 

**Key Points:**
1. ✅ All runners are properly configured as systemd services
2. ✅ All services are enabled for automatic startup
3. ✅ Runners are actively processing CI/CD jobs
4. ✅ Sudo permissions have been optimized for CI/CD operations
5. ✅ MCP dashboard functionality is fully validated and working
6. ✅ ARM64 CI/CD pipeline is functioning correctly

**No action required** - the GitHub Actions infrastructure is operating optimally.
