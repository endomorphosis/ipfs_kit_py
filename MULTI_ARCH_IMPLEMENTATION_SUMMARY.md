# Multi-Architecture Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the `ipfs_kit_py` repository works correctly with both ARM64 and x86_64 (AMD64) architectures.

## Changes Made

### 1. CI/CD Workflows

#### `.github/workflows/multi-arch-ci.yml`
- **Fixed**: Changed `runs-on: [self-hosted, ARM64]` to `runs-on: [self-hosted, arm64]` for consistency
- **Reason**: Runner labels should be lowercase for consistency across workflows
- **Impact**: Ensures jobs are correctly routed to ARM64 self-hosted runners

#### `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
- **Added**: QEMU setup step for multi-architecture emulation
  ```yaml
  - name: Set up QEMU
    uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3
    with:
      platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
  ```
- **Updated**: Build step to include both platforms
  ```yaml
  platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
  ```
- **Impact**: Docker images are now built and published for both architectures

### 2. Docker Configuration

#### `Dockerfile`
- **Added**: Multi-architecture build arguments
  ```dockerfile
  ARG TARGETPLATFORM
  ARG BUILDPLATFORM
  ```
- **Added**: Platform information logging for debugging
  ```dockerfile
  RUN echo "Building on $BUILDPLATFORM, targeting $TARGETPLATFORM"
  ```
- **Impact**: Docker builds correctly identify and target specific architectures

#### `docker/Dockerfile`
- **Added**: Same multi-architecture support as main Dockerfile
- **Impact**: All Dockerfile variants support multi-arch builds

### 3. Package Configuration

#### `pyproject.toml`
- **Updated**: Added explicit OS support in classifiers
  ```toml
  "Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux",
  "Operating System :: MacOS",
  ```
- **Impact**: Package metadata correctly indicates multi-OS/multi-arch support

### 4. Testing

#### `tests/test_architecture_support.py` (NEW)
- **Created**: Comprehensive test suite for architecture support
- **Tests include**:
  - Architecture detection validation
  - Package import verification on different architectures
  - Install script architecture detection (IPFS and Lotus)
  - Core module import verification
  - Binary compatibility checks
  - Python architecture compatibility
  - Multiprocessing availability
- **Special handling**: Added timeout for tests that may hang in CI environment
- **Impact**: Automated verification that the package works on both architectures

### 5. Documentation

#### `MULTI_ARCH_SUPPORT.md` (NEW)
- **Created**: Comprehensive multi-architecture support documentation
- **Sections include**:
  - Supported platforms and architectures
  - CI/CD pipeline explanation
  - Self-hosted runner setup
  - Docker multi-architecture builds
  - Architecture detection in installation scripts
  - Testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting guide
- **Impact**: Clear documentation for users and contributors

## Verification

### CI/CD Workflows
- ✅ YAML syntax validated for all modified workflows
- ✅ Runner labels are consistent across workflows
- ✅ Docker builds specify both amd64 and arm64 platforms

### Docker
- ✅ Dockerfiles include TARGETPLATFORM and BUILDPLATFORM args
- ✅ Multi-platform build configuration is correct

### Package Setup
- ✅ pyproject.toml includes proper OS classifiers
- ✅ No architecture-specific dependencies that would cause issues

### Installation Scripts
- ✅ `install_ipfs.py` correctly detects architecture via `hardware_detect()` and `dist_select()`
- ✅ `install_lotus.py` correctly detects architecture via `hardware_detect()` and `dist_select()`
- ✅ Both support x86_64, AMD64, ARM64, and AArch64

### Tests
- ✅ Architecture detection tests pass on x86_64
- ✅ Package import tests pass
- ✅ Python architecture compatibility tests pass
- ✅ Tests handle CI environment limitations (package locks, timeouts)

## Architecture Detection Logic

### Current Implementation
Both `install_ipfs.py` and `install_lotus.py` use:

1. **Primary**: `platform.machine()` - Most reliable for ARM64 detection
   - Maps: `aarch64` → `arm64`
   - Maps: `x86_64` → `x86_64`
   - Maps: `amd64` → `x86_64`

2. **Fallback**: Processor and architecture bit checks
   - Intel/AMD → x86_64 or x86
   - ARM/Qualcomm → arm64 or arm
   - Apple → arm64 (M1/M2/M3) or x86_64 (Intel Macs)

3. **Output format**: `"{os} {arch}"` (e.g., "linux arm64", "linux x86_64")

## Self-Hosted Runner Configuration

### ARM64 Runners
- **Labels**: `[self-hosted, arm64, dgx]` (for NVIDIA DGX systems)
- **Alternative**: `[self-hosted, arm64]` (for generic ARM64 systems)
- **Workflows**: `arm64-ci.yml`, `multi-arch-ci.yml`

### AMD64/x86_64 Runners
- **Labels**: `[self-hosted, amd64]`
- **Workflows**: `amd64-ci.yml`, `multi-arch-ci.yml`

### Important Notes
1. Runner labels must be configured when setting up self-hosted runners
2. Labels are case-sensitive and should be lowercase
3. Multiple labels can be used for more specific routing

## Docker Multi-Arch Usage

### Building for Multiple Architectures
```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t ipfs-kit-py:latest \
  --push \
  .
```

### Running Architecture-Specific Images
```bash
# Force AMD64 on any host
docker run --platform linux/amd64 ipfs-kit-py:latest

# Force ARM64 on any host (requires QEMU if not native)
docker run --platform linux/arm64 ipfs-kit-py:latest
```

### Image Manifest
The built images include a manifest that lists both architectures, allowing Docker to automatically pull the correct image for the host architecture.

## Testing Multi-Architecture Support

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all architecture tests
pytest tests/test_architecture_support.py -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_architecture_support.py::TestArchitectureSupport::test_architecture_detection -v

# Test in Docker on specific architecture
docker run --platform linux/arm64 ipfs-kit-py:latest pytest tests/test_architecture_support.py -v
```

### Manual Verification
```python
import platform
from ipfs_kit_py.install_ipfs import install_ipfs

print(f"Python detects: {platform.machine()}")

installer = install_ipfs()
print(f"Installer detects: {installer.dist_select()}")
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### ARM64 Considerations
1. **Build Times**: First-time builds may be slower due to source compilation
2. **Binary Availability**: Some dependencies may not have pre-built ARM64 wheels
3. **QEMU Performance**: Emulated builds are significantly slower than native

### CI/CD Considerations
1. **Package Manager Locks**: Some tests may timeout in CI if package manager is locked
2. **Self-Hosted Runners**: Require proper label configuration
3. **Resource Usage**: Multi-arch builds consume more resources and time

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. ✅ Add RISC-V support (experimental support already in `multi-arch-ci.yml`)
2. ⬜ Add Windows ARM64 support
3. ⬜ Optimize Docker layer caching for multi-arch builds
4. ⬜ Add architecture-specific performance benchmarks
5. ⬜ Create architecture-specific optimization flags

### Monitoring
1. Track build times across architectures
2. Monitor test success rates on different architectures
3. Track binary installation success rates

## Conclusion

The repository now has comprehensive multi-architecture support for ARM64 and x86_64, with:
- ✅ Consistent CI/CD workflows across architectures
- ✅ Proper Docker multi-arch build support
- ✅ Accurate architecture detection in installation scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Detailed documentation

All changes are minimal and focused on ensuring compatibility without breaking existing functionality.
