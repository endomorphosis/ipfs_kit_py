  --workflow daemon-config-tests.yml \
  --trigger --monitor
```

### Monitor Installation
```bash
python scripts/ci/monitor_first_install.py \
  --command "pip install ipfs-kit-py"
```

### Run Health Check
```bash
python scripts/ci/check_monitoring_health.py
```

### Run Demo
```bash
./scripts/ci/demo_workflow_monitoring.sh
```

## Testing Performed

### Local Testing
1. ✅ Workflow listing (without auth - proper error handling)
2. ✅ Installation verification (checked warnings)
3. ✅ Configuration checking (detected missing files)
4. ✅ Health check (15/16 passed - only auth missing)
5. ✅ Demo script (full execution)
6. ✅ Help text for all scripts
7. ✅ Script permissions and executability

### Output Verification
1. ✅ Console output with emoji indicators
2. ✅ Markdown report generation
3. ✅ JSON metrics export
4. ✅ Log file creation
5. ✅ Directory structure creation
6. ✅ Error messages and warnings

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Complements PR #70 Monitoring
- Works alongside ARM64 monitoring scripts
- Consistent logging format
- Shared output directories
- Compatible status indicators

### GitHub Actions Ready
- Environment variable support
- Artifact upload compatible
- Step summary integration
- Token-based authentication

## Output Locations

### Workflow Monitor
- `/tmp/workflow_monitor/` - Logs and reports
- `job_<ID>_logs.txt` - Job logs
- `run_<ID>_summary.md` - Run summaries
- `run_<ID>_data.json` - Full data

### Installation Monitor
- `/tmp/install_monitor/` - Logs and reports
- `installation_output.log` - Raw output
- `installation_report.md` - Report
- `installation_metrics.json` - Metrics

## Best Practices Documented

1. Always authenticate before workflow monitoring
2. Use appropriate poll intervals (10-30s)
3. Save artifacts in CI/CD
4. Review logs immediately after failures
5. Test locally before CI/CD integration
6. Use custom log directories
7. Monitor regularly during development

## Requirements

### For Workflow Monitoring
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed
- GitHub authentication configured
- Repository access permissions

### For Installation Monitoring
- Python 3.8+
- Write access to `/tmp/`
- No additional dependencies

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- ✅ 2,101 lines of new code
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Consistent coding style
- ✅ Detailed documentation
- ✅ Working examples
