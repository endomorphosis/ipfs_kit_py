## 📝 Notes & Challenges

- WebRTC integration requires careful handling due to asyncio dependencies
- Need to ensure backward compatibility during transition
- Some files may need both asyncio and anyio versions temporarily
- Test suite will need updates to work with both backends
- Trio compatibility may require special handling in some cases
