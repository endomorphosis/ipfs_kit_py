🎉 COMPREHENSIVE DASHBOARD INTEGRATION - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! 🎉

This document celebrates the successful completion of the comprehensive
dashboard integration, achieving FULL FEATURE PARITY with the original
comprehensive MCP dashboard while maintaining the modern bucket-centric
architecture.

PROBLEM SOLVED: "none of the features of the mcp server are showing up on the dashboard after i did the refactoring"
