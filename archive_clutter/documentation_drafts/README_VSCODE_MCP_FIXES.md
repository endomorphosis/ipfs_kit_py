# VSCode MCP Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to make the VSCode integration with the MCP server work correctly.

## Issue Summary

The VSCode extension was unable to connect to the MCP server because it was missing a critical initialization endpoint. When VSCode tries to connect to an MCP server, it first sends a request to `/api/v0/initialize` to get information about the server's capabilities.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Initialization Endpoint**: We added a POST endpoint `/api/v0/initialize` to the MCP server that responds with capability information including:
   - Available tools: ipfs_add, ipfs_cat, ipfs_pin, storage_transfer
   - Available resources: ipfs://info, storage://backends
   - Server information including name and version

2. **Fixed Integration Script**: We also created a comprehensive test script `test_vscode_mcp_integration.py` that verifies all the critical components for VSCode integration:
   - Server root accessibility
   - Initialization endpoint functionality
   - JSON-RPC endpoint functionality (both at root and API-prefixed paths)
   - SSE event streaming capabilities

## Testing Results

The test script confirmed that all critical endpoints are working correctly:

```
=== VS Code MCP Integration Test ===
ℹ Testing server at http://localhost:9994/api/v0
ℹ Timeout: 5 seconds

=== Testing Server Health ===
✓ Server root endpoint is accessible

=== Testing Initialize Endpoint ===
✓ Initialize endpoint responded successfully
✓ Response includes capabilities
ℹ Available tools: ipfs_add, ipfs_cat, ipfs_pin, storage_transfer
ℹ Available resources: ipfs://info, storage://backends

=== Testing JSON-RPC Endpoints ===
ℹ Testing endpoint: http://localhost:9994/jsonrpc
✓ JSON-RPC endpoint /jsonrpc responded with capabilities
ℹ Testing endpoint: http://localhost:9994/api/v0/jsonrpc
✓ JSON-RPC endpoint /api/v0/jsonrpc responded with capabilities

=== Testing SSE Endpoint ===
ℹ Testing SSE endpoint: http://localhost:9994/api/v0/sse
✓ SSE endpoint is available with correct content type
✓ Received SSE data

=== Test Summary ===
✓ Critical VSCode integration endpoints are working!
```

## Usage

1. Start the MCP server with the enhanced functionality:
   ```bash
   ./start_mcp_stack.sh
   ```

2. Test the VSCode integration:
   ```bash
   ./test_vscode_mcp_integration.py
   ```

3. VSCode should now be able to connect to the MCP server and use its tools through the MCP extension.

## Configuration Files

The VSCode settings have been updated in:
- `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
- `~/.config/Code - Insiders/User/settings.json`

To ensure they point to the correct MCP server endpoints:
- MCP SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:9994/api/v0/sse`
- JSON-RPC endpoint: `http://localhost:9994/jsonrpc`

## Remaining Issues

While all critical endpoints for VSCode integration are working, there are some non-critical issues that could be addressed in the future:

1. The IPFS add endpoint returns a 404 error
2. The health endpoint has an error related to the HuggingFaceModel missing an 'isolation_mode' attribute

These issues don't impact the VSCode integration functionality but could be fixed to improve overall system stability.
