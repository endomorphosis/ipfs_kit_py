# ARM64 Testing Parity Implementation

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED - Testing Parity Achieved**

---

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of ARM64 testing parity across all GitHub Actions workflows. The goal is to ensure that all tests running on x86_64 (AMD64) also run on ARM64 architecture to validate cross-platform compatibility.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

We implemented a matrix-based strategy that allows workflows to run on both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures:

1. **Conditional Runner Selection:** Use `fromJSON()` to select self-hosted ARM64 runners or standard GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners
2. **Architecture Matrix:** Add `arch: [amd64, arm64]` to strategy matrices
3. **Conditional Python Setup:** Use different setup steps for AMD64 (actions/setup-python) vs ARM64 (manual venv)
4. **Artifact Naming:** Update artifact names to include architecture identifier

### Key Pattern

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on ${{ matrix.arch }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.arch == 'arm64' && fromJSON('["self-hosted", "arm64", "dgx"]') || 'ubuntu-20.04' }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        arch: [amd64, arm64]
        python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python (AMD64)
      if: matrix.arch == 'amd64'
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Set up Python (ARM64)
      if: matrix.arch == 'arm64'
      run: |
        if command -v python${{ matrix.python-version }} >/dev/null 2>&1; then
          python${{ matrix.python-version }} -m venv venv
        else
          python3 -m venv venv
        fi
        source venv/bin/activate
        echo "venv/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

- **Before:** 6 jobs (6 Python versions × 1 architecture)
- **After:** 12 jobs (6 Python versions × 2 architectures)
- **Coverage:** 100% parity

**Example: cluster-tests.yml**
- **Before:** 4 jobs (4 Python versions × 1 architecture)
- **After:** 8 jobs (4 Python versions × 2 architectures)

## Architecture Compatibility Features

### 1. Conditional Runner Selection

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ matrix.arch == 'arm64' && fromJSON('["self-hosted", "arm64", "dgx"]') || 'ubuntu-20.04' }}
```

This pattern:
- Uses self-hosted ARM64 runners (label: `self-hosted, arm64, dgx`) for ARM64 tests
- Uses standard GitHub-hosted runners for AMD64 tests
- Allows dynamic runner selection based on matrix variable

### 2. Python Environment Setup

**AMD64 (GitHub Actions):**
```yaml
- name: Set up Python (AMD64)
  if: matrix.arch == 'amd64'
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

**ARM64 (Self-hosted):**
```yaml
- name: Set up Python (ARM64)
  if: matrix.arch == 'arm64'
  run: |
    if command -v python${{ matrix.python-version }} >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      python${{ matrix.python-version }} -m venv venv
    else
      python3 -m venv venv
    fi
    source venv/bin/activate
    echo "venv/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

### 3. Artifact Naming

Updated artifact uploads to include architecture:
```yaml
- name: Upload test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: test-results-${{ matrix.arch }}-${{ matrix.python-version }}
    path: test-results-${{ matrix.python-version }}.xml
```

## Testing Instructions

### Run Workflows on Both Architectures

All updated workflows will automatically run on both AMD64 and ARM64 when triggered:

```bash
# Trigger via push
git push origin main

# Trigger manually
gh workflow run run-tests.yml
gh workflow run daemon-tests.yml
gh workflow run cluster-tests.yml
```

### Monitor Test Results

```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=run-tests.yml

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Download test artifacts
gh run download <run-id>
```

### Verify Parity

```bash
# Run the parity validation workflow
gh workflow run multi-arch-test-parity.yml

# Check the parity report artifact
gh run download <run-id> -n test-parity-report
cat parity-report.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: ARM64 Runner Not Available

**Symptom:** Workflow queued indefinitely

**Solution:**
1. Check self-hosted runner status: `gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runners`
2. Ensure runner is online and has label `arm64` and `dgx`
3. Fallback to QEMU testing via `multi-arch-test-parity.yml`

### Issue: Python Version Not Available on ARM64

**Symptom:** venv creation fails

**Solution:**
1. Install required Python version on ARM64 runner
2. Update workflow to use available version
3. Use pyenv for multiple Python versions

### Issue: Test Failures Only on ARM64

**Symptom:** Tests pass on AMD64 but fail on ARM64

**Solution:**
1. Check test logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log`
2. Download architecture-specific artifacts
3. Review architecture-specific dependencies
4. Check for endianness or pointer size issues
