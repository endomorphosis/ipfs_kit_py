# Next Steps for IPFS Kit Python

## Latest Implementation (April 2024)

### System Statistics and Daemon Status Methods

We've successfully implemented two important methods in the MCP server:

1. **System Statistics (`get_stats()`)**: 
   - Provides comprehensive system statistics including CPU, memory, disk usage, and network metrics
   - Includes performance metrics for operations and cache hits/misses
   - Features health scoring based on resource utilization
   - Implements AnyIO compatibility for both asyncio and trio backends
   - Exposed via `/ipfs/stats` endpoint

2. **Daemon Status Checking (`check_daemon_status()`)**: 
   - Performs role-based daemon status checking (master/worker/leecher)
   - Provides status information for multiple daemon types (IPFS, IPFS Cluster, etc.)
   - Implements overall health assessment with color coding (healthy, degraded, critical)
   - Features AnyIO compatibility for async operation
   - Exposed via `/ipfs/daemon/status` endpoint

Both endpoints have been implemented in the standard and AnyIO-compatible controllers, ensuring full functionality regardless of the async backend used. This brings the MCP server implementation to 50% completion based on endpoint count.

## MCP Server Fixes (Previous Implementation)

We've also previously enhanced the MCP server by fixing bytes response handling in the following methods:

1. `get_content`
2. `add_content`
3. `pin_content`
4. `unpin_content`
5. `list_pins`
6. `ipfs_name_publish`
7. `ipfs_name_resolve`

All tests in `test_mcp_comprehensive_fixes.py` are now passing, verifying that our fixes handle bytes responses correctly.

## Next Priorities

### 1. WebRTC Controller Implementation

The WebRTC controller is essential for streaming capabilities, which are important for modern web applications. The implementation should focus on:

- WebRTC capability detection and reporting
- Peer connection management
- Video and audio streaming configuration
- Content streaming via WebRTC
- Dashboard interface for monitoring

This controller already has WebRTC methods implemented in the IPFS model, but the controller endpoints need to be exposed and properly integrated.

### 2. Credential Controller Implementation

The credential controller is important for managing API keys and authentication:

- List, create, update, and delete credentials
- Validate credentials during API calls
- Support for different authentication methods
- Role-based access controls

### 3. Distributed Controller Implementation

The distributed controller manages cluster coordination:

- Node discovery and heartbeats
- Task distribution and collection
- Distributed pinning strategy
- Replication management
- Content routing optimization

### 4. FileSystem Journal Controller Implementation

The filesystem journal controller enables persistent operation logging:

- Journal entry creation and listing
- Operation tracking and replay
- Transaction support for atomic operations
- Recovery from interrupted operations

## Additional Enhancements

### ParquetCIDCache Improvements

- Workload-based schema optimization
- Cross-node metadata synchronization
- Advanced partitioning strategies
- Parallel query execution
- Probabilistic data structures for efficient operations

### General System Improvements

- Full metrics integration with Prometheus
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Security improvements for API endpoints
- Documentation and example updates

## Implementation Strategy

The recommended approach is to focus on one controller at a time, starting with the WebRTC controller since it's the most complex and already has model methods implemented. For each controller:

1. Design the required Pydantic models for requests/responses
2. Implement the controller methods
3. Register the routes
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Add tests for the new endpoints
6. Add documentation for the API

The implementation should prioritize AnyIO compatibility from the start, implementing both standard and AnyIO-compatible versions of the controller simultaneously.

## Completed Tasks Overview

1. ✅ IPFS Model Methods Implementation
   - Added `get_stats()` and `check_daemon_status()` methods
   - Added AnyIO-compatible versions of these methods
   - Comprehensive error handling and result standardization

2. ✅ Controller Endpoints Implementation
   - Added endpoints in standard IPFS controller
   - Added endpoints in AnyIO-compatible controller
   - Implemented request/response models with Pydantic

3. ✅ Documentation Updates
   - Updated MCP_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md with latest progress
   - Created NEXT_STEPS.md to document progress and priorities
   - Updated implementation checklist to reflect completed tasks

4. ✅ Previous MCP Server Fixes
   - Fixed bytes response handling in core IPFS methods
   - Addressed indentation issues in `ipfs_name_resolve` method
   - Implemented comprehensive testing for fixes

The MCP server now has all previously identified missing methods implemented, with the project reaching 50% completion based on endpoint count (23 out of 46 endpoints now working).
