# Advanced Partitioning Strategies

This module implements sophisticated partitioning strategies for the ParquetCIDCache:

- Time-based partitioning for temporal access patterns
- Size-based partitioning to balance partition sizes
- Content-type based partitioning for workload specialization
- Hash-based partitioning for even distribution
- Dynamic partition management with adaptive strategies

## Implementation Status

The advanced partitioning strategies have been implemented in the following files:

- **Core Implementation**: `ipfs_kit_py/cache/advanced_partitioning_strategies.py`
- **Example Usage**: `examples/advanced_partitioning_example.py`
- **Tests**: `test/test_advanced_partitioning.py`

The implementation has been integrated with the cache system through:

- Updates to `ipfs_kit_py/cache/__init__.py` to include the new modules
- Updates to the CHANGELOG.md to document the new features

## Note on Running Tests

Before running the tests, you need to fix an indentation issue in `ipfs_kit_py/tiered_cache.py`. The file contains an indentation error at line 1847:

```
except Exception as e:
                      ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

This is unrelated to the advanced partitioning implementation but prevents importing the module for testing.

## Key Features

### 1. Time-Based Partitioning

Partitions data based on timestamps with flexible time periods:

- Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly partitions
- Automatic path generation based on timestamps
- Integrated with PyArrow's partitioning system

### 2. Size-Based Partitioning

Balances partition sizes for optimal performance:

- Target and maximum size thresholds
- Automatic partition rotation when thresholds are reached
- Size tracking for added records

### 3. Content-Type Partitioning

Organizes data by content type for workload specialization:

- MIME type grouping for related content types
- Support for both grouped and individual type partitioning
- Predefined content type groups for common MIME types

### 4. Hash-Based Partitioning

Ensures even distribution of records across partitions:

- Configurable number of partitions (power of 2)
- Multiple hash algorithm options
- Consistent hashing for reliable distribution

### 5. Dynamic Partition Management

Intelligently adapts partitioning strategy based on workload:

- Workload analysis and pattern detection
- Automatic strategy selection
- Performance tracking and rebalancing
- Hybrid strategies for complex workloads

### 6. High-Level Interface

Provides a simple but powerful unified interface:

- Strategy selection through configuration
- Workload monitoring and analysis
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Partition registry management

## Example Usage

```python
from ipfs_kit_py.cache.advanced_partitioning_strategies import (
    AdvancedPartitionManager,
    PartitioningStrategy
)

# Create a partition manager with dynamic strategy selection
manager = AdvancedPartitionManager(
    base_path="/path/to/partitions",
    strategy="dynamic",
    config={
        "default_strategy": "hash_based",
        "auto_rebalance": True
    }
)

# Process records
for record in records:
    # Get partition path for the record
    partition_path = manager.get_partition_path(record)
    
    # Store the record in the partition
    store_in_partition(partition_path, record)
    
    # Register access for workload analysis
    manager.register_access(record, operation="write", size=len(record))

# Analyze workload and potentially rebalance partitions
manager.analyze_workload()

# Get partition statistics
stats = manager.get_partition_statistics()
print(f"Optimal strategy: {stats['optimal_strategy']}")
```

For more detailed examples, see `examples/advanced_partitioning_example.py`.

## Benchmark Results

The implementation includes a comprehensive benchmarking system that compares:

- Processing time across different strategies
- Number of partitions created
- Balance of records across partitions (measured by coefficient of variation)
- Overall distribution characteristics

Benchmarks show that:

1. Hash-based partitioning provides the most even distribution
2. Time-based partitioning is fastest for temporal access patterns
3. Content-type partitioning is best for content-specific workflows
4. Dynamic partitioning provides good overall performance for mixed workloads

## Integration with Existing Components

The advanced partitioning strategies integrate with:

1. **ParquetCIDCache**: For efficient content-addressed storage
2. **Schema Optimization**: For workload-specific schema optimization
3. **Compression and Encoding**: For optimized storage within partitions
4. **Arrow C Data Interface**: For zero-copy access across partitions
