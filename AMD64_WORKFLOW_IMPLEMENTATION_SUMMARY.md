- ✅ Unit test execution
- ✅ Build-from-source capability testing
- ✅ Package building and installation
- ✅ Docker image building
- ✅ Monitoring and logging
- ✅ Artifact uploads
- ✅ Cleanup procedures

### Differences

| Aspect | ARM64 | AMD64 |
|--------|-------|-------|

| Platform | `linux/arm64` | `linux/amd64` |
| Monitoring Script | `monitor_arm64_installation.py` | `monitor_amd64_installation.py` |
| Verify Script | `verify_arm64_dependencies.py` | `verify_amd64_dependencies.py` |

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Multi-Architecture CI Pipeline

The enhanced `multi-arch-ci.yml` now provides:

1. **QEMU-based Testing**: amd64, arm64, armv7
2. **Native ARM64 Testing**: Self-hosted ARM64 runners
3. **Native AMD64 Testing**: Self-hosted AMD64 runners (NEW)
4. **Experimental RISC-V**: Manual trigger support

This creates a comprehensive testing matrix across:
- 3 architectures (native)
- 3+ architectures (emulated)
- 3-4 Python versions per architecture
- Multiple operating systems

### Existing AMD64 Workflows

The new `amd64-ci.yml` complements existing workflows:

**`amd64-python-package.yml`** (GitHub-hosted):
- Continues to provide standard AMD64 testing
- Uses GitHub's infrastructure
- Good for PR checks and general validation

**`amd64-release.yml`** (GitHub-hosted):
- Handles AMD64-specific releases
- Builds optimized packages
- Creates Docker images with AMD64 optimizations
- Publishes to PyPI

**`amd64-ci.yml`** (Self-hosted) - NEW:
- Tests on custom AMD64 hardware
- Validates on target deployment environment
- Useful for hardware-specific features
- Can test GPU capabilities (with CUDA)

## Self-Hosted Runner Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- CPU: x86_64/AMD64 architecture
- RAM: 4GB (8GB+ recommended)
- Disk: 20GB free space
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)

**Software:**
