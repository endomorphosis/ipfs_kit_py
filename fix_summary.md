# ResourceWarning Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **WebRTC Streaming ResourceWarnings**
   - Fixed `WebRTCStreamingManager.close_all_connections` to properly cancel the metrics_task
   - Improved the test code's handling of AsyncMock objects to prevent ResourceWarnings
   - Added proper cleanup of peer connections in test teardown

2. **WAL Telemetry ResourceWarnings**
   - Fixed directory creation issues in the following methods:
     - `_store_metrics_arrow`: Added directory creation before writing Parquet files
     - `_store_metrics_json`: Added directory creation before writing JSON files
     - `_clean_up_old_metrics`: Added check if directory exists before attempting to list files

## Fix Implementation Approach

1. **Manual Code Inspection**
   - Examined the error messages to identify the specific issues
   - Located the problematic methods in the codebase

2. **WebRTC Fix Implementation**
   - Added code to check if metrics_task exists and call cancel() on it
   - Improved the test implementation to handle AsyncMock objects properly

3. **WAL Telemetry Fix Implementation**
   - Created a fix script using regex to modify the WAL telemetry code
   - Added os.makedirs() calls with exist_ok=True before file operations
   - Added existence checks before directory listing

4. **Fix Verification**
   - Tested specific components to verify that ResourceWarnings were eliminated
   - Used PYTHONWARNINGS=error::ResourceWarning to ensure ResourceWarnings would cause test failures
   - Successfully ran tests with ResourceWarning detection enabled to verify our fixes

## Benefits of Fixes

1. **Improved Resource Management**
   - Properly closed resources (threads, event loops, files) to prevent leaks
   - Ensured directories exist before file operations to prevent exceptions

2. **Enhanced Code Robustness**
   - Added defensive coding practices to handle edge cases
   - Improved error handling to gracefully manage potential issues

3. **Better Test Quality**
   - Fixed test code to properly handle AsyncMock objects
   - Eliminated false positive ResourceWarnings in tests
   - Ensured proper resource cleanup during test execution

These fixes make the codebase more robust by ensuring proper resource management and error handling, particularly in the WebRTC streaming and WAL telemetry modules.
